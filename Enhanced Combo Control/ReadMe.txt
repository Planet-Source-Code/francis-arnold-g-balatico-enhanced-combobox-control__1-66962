This is an enhanced version of the VB Combobox Control. This is actually a complimentary control for Priyank Modi's Enhanced Text control.  I've added some GUI functionality and some built in features which include :

-> Basic autocomplete functionality
-> Built-in search function
-> Control over the colors of the different states (Normal, Focus, Disabled) specifically on the following:
	*BackColor
	*BorderColor
	*GrooveColor

-> Flat look and feel
-> Control over border pattern
-> Function to fill combobox from database
-> Reasonably fast adding of items
-> Tab on enter functionality
-> Control over item alignment

Updates to follow.


*Side Note

For better performance, compile the usercontrol into an ocx and register. I have provided a ready to compile project in the "Compile This" folder for those of you who will be having problems with compiling.

Your vote is highly appreciated and your comments / suggestions are most welcome.

Thanks and God Bless!!!!
